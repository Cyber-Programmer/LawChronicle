# LawChronicle Improvement Plan

Date: 2025-08-26

## Sources and Assumptions
- The file docs/requirements.md is not present in the repository at the time of writing. Therefore, this plan derives goals and constraints from:
  - docs/tasks.md (LawChronicle Improvement Tasks Checklist)
  - README.md (project overview, current status, architecture, and features)
- Assumption: The checklist in docs/tasks.md reflects current priorities and non-functional constraints for nearâ€‘term delivery.

## Key Goals (extracted)
- Deliver a robust, secure, observable, and typed web application for legal document processing with Azure OpenAI integration (README: Architecture, Key Features).
- Maintain a consistent, versioned API surface with strong error semantics, pagination, and idempotency to support Phases 1â€“6 (README Pipeline Phases; tasks 43â€“46).
- Ensure developer productivity, cross-platform experience (Windows parity), and CI quality gates (tasks 14â€“19, 61â€“67).

## Key Constraints (extracted)
- Security and privacy: PII handling, secrets management, CSP, secure cookies, JWT-based RBAC (tasks 8, 51â€“53, 70).
- Operational: Azure OpenAI quotas/latency, SSE resource usage, MongoDB performance (tasks 31â€“34, 56, 26â€“30).
- Quality gates: Formatting, linting, type-checks, unit/integration/E2E tests in CI (tasks 14â€“19, 41â€“43, 63).
- Documentation accuracy: README has formatting/link issues and duplicate status sections (tasks 1â€“2; README noted issues).

## Implementation Sequencing (Suggested)
1. Documentation hygiene and governance (Tasks 1â€“8): low risk, immediate value.
2. Quality gates and observability foundations (14â€“19, 15â€“16, 47â€“49).
3. API standards and backend reliability (20â€“25, 43â€“46).
4. Database performance and retention (26â€“30).
5. Frontend resilience and typing (35â€“42).
6. AI resiliency and cost control (31â€“34).
7. Security enhancements (50â€“53) and performance tuning (54â€“56).
8. Testing maturity and DevOps/DX (57â€“67), containers and CI/CD (61â€“65), enable feature flags and samples (68â€“69).
9. Governance, a11y, i18n, roadmap, metrics (70â€“73, 78â€“79).

## Risks and Mitigations
- Azure OpenAI rate limits and cost: Implement backpressure, concurrency caps, and circuit breakers; add dry-run modes for bulk AI tasks.
- SSE memory retention: Stream responses carefully; set heartbeats/timeouts; test long-lived streams.
- Token freshness and clock skew: Add refresh rotation and skew tolerance; synchronize server time.
- Data migration risk: Start with compatibility layers; add backups and rollback procedures.
